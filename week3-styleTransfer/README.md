## Presentation: [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QJumvGwCzErFJFva2LnqNLUmIDp_uz83fPWC6iCR3l0/edit?usp=sharing)
- What is Style Transfer
- How does it work
- What Neural Networks See
- Different kinds of style transfer
- How to use Spell.run to train your own style transfer
- Use the trained model in ml5.js (one image and webcam images)
